The Adenoma Program was created to automate the Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly Adenoma Report.

This program was created for use by the Mohawk Valley Endoscopy Center.

It is used to create a report that used to take weeks of labor to do. Now, the report can be done in under an hour.

The executable file (.exe) could not have been created without pyinstaller, so special thanks to pyinstaller.

Microsoft Excel is required. Python is not required to run the executable.

This software is available freely, but will not work without the required MACRO file. The MACRO file was not uploaded to github. Some of the .bas files were also altered slightly to protect the Doctors' names. No patient data was uploaded. This software is only useful if you have the correct files that only the Mohawk Valley Endoscopy Center has access to.
